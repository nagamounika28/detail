        <summary>what is the use of &operator in java</summary>
     <p>The AND operator preserves non-Boolean values and returns them as they are: Even though the && operator can be used with non-Boolean operands, it is still considered a boolean operator since its return value can always be converted to a boolean primitive .</p>

        <summary>What is the difference between '&' and '&&' in Java?</summary>
        <p>The key difference between && and & operators is that && supports short-circuit evaluations while & operator does not. Another difference is that && will evaluate the expression exp1, and immediately return a false value if exp1 is false. While & operator always evaluates both expressions (exp1 and exp2) before retiring an answer.</p>
